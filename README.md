# Netflix Data ETL Pipeline using PySpark and Airflow

This project demonstrates a scalable and automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using PySpark for data transformation and Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration. The pipeline processes Netflix titles data, applying transformations and generating insights, such as distribution of content by rating and genre.

# Features

- **PySpark** for handling large datasets efficiently and performing transformations.
  
- **Airflow DAG** to automate and schedule the ETL pipeline execution.
  
- Data visualizations showcasing insights such as rating distribution, content type distribution and genre trends.

- Clean, modular code structure for easy understanding and modification.
